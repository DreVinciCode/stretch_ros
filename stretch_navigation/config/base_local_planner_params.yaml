    min_vel_x: 0.01
    max_vel_theta: 0.1
    min_in_place_vel_theta: 0.05

    ## Goal Tolerance Parameters
    yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.09 # (5 degrees) The tolerance in radians for the controller in yaw/rotation when achieving its goal
    xy_goal_tolerance: 0.10 # (10cm) The tolerance in meters for the controller in the x & y distance when achieving a goal
    latch_xy_goal_tolerance: false #If goal tolerance is latched, if the robot ever reaches the goal xy location it will simply rotate in place, even if it ends up outside the goal tolerance while it is doing so.

    ## Forward Simulation Parameters
    sim_time: 1.7 # The amount of time to forward-simulate trajectories in seconds
    sim_granularity: 0.025 # The step size, in meters, to take between points on a given trajectory

    vx_samples: 25 # The number of samples to use when exploring the x velocity space
    vy_samples: 0 # The number of samples to use when exploring the y velocity space
    vtheta_samples: 25 # The number of samples to use when exploring the theta velocity space

    penalize_negative_x: false # Whether to penalize trajectories that have negative x velocities.

    ## Trajectory Scoring Parameters
    path_distance_bias: 75.0 # The weighting for how much the controller should stay close to the path it was given
    goal_distance_bias: 40.0 # The weighting for how much the controller should attempt to reach its local goal, also controls speed

    occdist_scale: 0.03 # The weighting for how much the controller should attempt to avoid obstacles
    forward_point_distance: 0.325 # The distance from the center point of the robot to place an additional scoring point, in meters
    stop_time_buffer: 0.2 # The amount of time that the robot must stop before a collision in order for a trajectory to be considered valid in seconds
    scaling_speed: 0.25 # The absolute value of the veolicty at which to start scaling the robot's footprint, in m/s
    max_scaling_factor: 0.1 # The maximum factor to scale the robot's footprint by

    ## Global Plan Parameters
    prune_plan: true # Defines whether or not to eat up the plan as the robot moves along the path. If set to true, points will fall off the end of the plan once the robot moves 1 meter past them.
    oscillation_reset_dist: 0.05 # How far the robot must travel in meters before oscillation flags are reset
    meter_scoring: true
